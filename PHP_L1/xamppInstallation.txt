As promissed, find URL's for installation of XAMPP software for running MySQL/PHP below.
 
http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/xampp/xampp-win32-1.6.3a-installer.exe
 
Installation docs are here (but it's only 2 steps):
 
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#522
 
Basically, it installs an icon in your system tray that you can click  to open the XAMPP control panel, where you can start and stop  services like Apache and MySQL.
 
Once it's installed visit "http://localhost" and you will see the XAMPP homepage, where you can read the docs (as taught  and demonstrated in lessons), and crucially access  phpMyAdmin which you can use to access MySQL.

Bookmark these resources after completing download:
XAMPP homepage -  http://localhost/xampp/index.php 
PHPMyAdmin -   http://localhost/phpmyadmin/  
Working direectory - PHP files c:\xampp\htdocs

(Dont't  worry too much about MySQL as we have not begun this aspect of your course.The software is to help you run php from  Apache).

Also, visit the Biopic and the Blog sites listed below to acquaint with related technologies in Digital and Future Media.
