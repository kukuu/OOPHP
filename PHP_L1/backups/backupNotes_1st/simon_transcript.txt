Thanks for coming in yesterday. The areas we have identified below sound good to me. I will let you know when I return from annual leave and we can get cracking on this. Personnel have asked me how many hours you think this might require – what do you think?

 

Below is the information you requested and I’ll speak to you soon.

Thanks,

Hi Alex,

 

I’m afraid I’m on holiday from Monday 27 August (which is also a bank holiday). I won’t be back in the office until Thursday 14 September. I am free after this date to meet and can be flexible to suit your availability.

Hi Alex,

 

Below are the points we would like to achieve:

 

-          Learn the basics of MYSQL to:

o        Troubleshoot MYSQL errors on the www.citylit.ac.uk website

o        Create simple databases that are operable on the website

o        Edit existing databases on the website

 

Does this sound reasonable? 

 

Let me know if there is there anything I need to do in preparation for the meeting. Also, having done a little research I note that the software for MYSQL can be downloaded for free off the website – if there any other software that would be of use? We currently use Dreamweaver for basic editing of the website and I access the basic MYSQL databases to run a report (download names and address entered on the website).

 

Thanks,

Simon
