
Below are the points we would like to achieve:

 

-          Learn the basics of MYSQL to:

o        Troubleshoot MYSQL errors on the www.citylit.ac.uk website

o        Create simple databases that are operable on the website

o        Edit existing databases on the website

 

Does this sound reasonable?
